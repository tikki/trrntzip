 Installation 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
1...> Build and install zlib.

2...> Copy the all the files in the src directory to somewhere on your machine.

3...> Change to the directory you just created above, and run the following commands :

      ./autogen.sh
      ./configure
      make
      
      If all goes well, you will end up with a trrntzip executable in the src dir.
