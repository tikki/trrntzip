 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 There are a few of ways to contact the makers and users of this project
 (see links below). You can find many of us wasting time ... uh ... hanging
 out in the #romtorrent channel on the IRC foreverchat network.  There is
 also the forum at Petr1fied's fabulous website (you'll need to create an
 account, but then, you have nothing to hide, right?).

 1. What is TorrentZip? 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 TorrentZip (TZ) is a replacement for MAMEZip. It creates byte-for-byte exact
 zip files on any machine. This allows people to join a torrent (after they
 have converted their zip files with TZ) with a partial romset, thus
 preventing them from having to download the entire set again. Because of the
 way it creates identical zips, the file hashes will always match those in the
 original torrent. It has been written in ANSI and POSIX compliant C such that
 it can be built and run cross-platform (Windows, Linux, OS-X etc) and has
 been tested on 32bit, 64bit, Little-Endian and Big-Endian architectures.
 ___________________________________
 2. Why use TZ instead of MAMEZip? 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 This section provides the key differences between TZ and MAMEZip.
 ______________
 2.1 INI file 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 TZ does not use an INI file like MAMEZip. The way it achieves this is it
 places a special string in the global comment of converted zips. The comment
 looks like this:

 TORRENTZIPPED-XXXXXXXX
 e.g.
 TORRENTZIPPED-09FE247A

 The last 8 bytes is the CRC32 of all the bytes in the zip file central
 directory. This allows TZ to detect any changes to the zip file by any app.
 This includes ClrMAME Pro, regardless of what settings it has been configured
 to use (retain timestamps etc). Because TZ uses this method instead of
 storing exact path and timestamp info in an INI file (like MAMEZip), roms can
 be moved around anywhere on your computer. Files will be still be detected as
 already TorrentZipped wherever they are. It also means that a first-time
 downloader does not have to TorrentZip the already TorrentZipped romset they
 have downloaded just to get a valid INI file (as with MAMEZip).
 ____________________
 2.2 Subdirectories 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 TZ supports the scanning of subdirectories below the passed path.
 ______________________________
 2.3 Supported filename chars 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 TZ will handle any characters in the filenames, unlike MAMEZip. Examples of
 these are the accented characters like [é] and [ü].
 ____________________________
 2.4 Internal filename case 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 TZ retains the case of internal files in the zip, unlike MAMEZip which makes
 them all lowercase.
 __________
 2.5 Logs 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 TZ creates log files, one for processing info ([DIR]_[TIMESTAMP].log), and one
 for errors (error.log). This allows the user to review a long conversion
 process after it has completed.
 ____________
 2.6 Errors 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 TZ won't stop the complete process when an error is found. When MAMEZip
 discovered a zip it couldn't handle (i.e. a corrupt file), it would stop
 completely. TZ will simply log the error, and move onto the next zip file.
 __________
 2.7 zlib 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 TZ uses the excellent zlib library, unlike JazzLib in MAMEZip. TZ achieves
 slightly better compression as a result.
 __________________
 2.8 Written in C 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 TZ is written in C, so it's considerably faster than MAMEZip.
 ________________________
 3. Usage (commandline) 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 TZ is very simple to use. It's a commandline app, so it has commandline
 parameters. This main parameter is the path/zip file that contains the roms
 you want to convert to TZ format. Remember, if a path is passed TZ supports
 sub-directories, so it will also scan these under the path you provide.
 Therefore, the calling convention is as follows :

 trrntzip <OPTIONS> <PATH/ZIP FILE>

 You don't have to use the commandline if you don't wish to. You can drag a
 folder to the executable within your GUI OS environment. This will
 automatically pass the path to TZ. You can then review the log files that TZ
 creates during the process.
 _________________________
 3.1 Commandline options 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 -? : show commandline help
 -d : strip sub-directories from zips
 -s : prevent sub-directory recursion
 -v : show version

 4. Usage (GUI) 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 Also available on the Sourceforge homepage is a Java based GUI for those that
 wish to use it. Please see the TorrentZip for Dummies document linked to at
 the start of this document for instructions on it's use.

 5. Credits and Thanks 
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 There are so many people who have been instrumental in getting this project up
 and running (aside from the authors - you can read AUTHORS for the skinny on
 those geeks). TorrentZip would never have existed if it wasn't for the great
 people over at the Pleasuredome Trinity web-sites, who have extensively used
 MAMEZip for their rom torrents, making it very easy to for everyone to keep
 up-to-date. Here are the links to these web-sites :

 We would like to thank the following people for their assistance and support
 during the construction of TZ (in no particular order) :

 Jano        : The original author of MAMEZip, without which we would not be
               inspired.
 Petr1fied   : For the great site.
 Tor_RentBoy : For the abuse.
